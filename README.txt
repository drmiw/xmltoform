This module reads in the file form.xml and creates a web form using Form API.

Date picker functionality is provided by the required Date module.

The date format for the 'Date of birth' fieldset depends on the 'Short' Date
Type format which is set in the standard way at admin/config/regional/date-time.

Client side validation for the web form is provided by the required 'Clientside
Validation' module.

To run tests you must first enable the Testing module (a Core Drupal module)
and then go to admin/config/development/testing/.
